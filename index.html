        <h1 id="title">Hello, I'm Mathias Mellemstuen</h1>
        <span id="under-text">This is my website </span>
        <p>I'm a computer engineer from Norway who has a wide range of interests where most of them is somewhat (and somehow) connected to programming.  This website is where I'm going to showcase what I'm working on.</p>
        <p>If you are interested in what I've done educationally, have a look <a href="https://cv.mathias.mellemstuen.no">here</a>.</p>
        <h2>Why not just a normal background?<span class="smaller-text"> Many have asked...</span></h2>
        <p>To be honest, choosing a background color or picture is a hard thing. I also don't find myself very good at design. I had also recently read about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve" target="_blank">Bézier curves</a> which inspired me to create visual patterns with it. The only logical choice for me was to code it and use it as a background.</p>
        <h2 id="under-title">All projects</h2>
        <p>This is a list of all my open source projects that I think is worth to showcase:</p>
        <ul id="project-list">

                    <span class="list-container-title">Game Engine Prototype</span>
                    <span class="list-container-under-text">The engine is made in C++. Using Vulkan Graphics API for rendering and ImGUI for creating debugging features in the game engine. It is planned to be a programming oriented game engine with a rich set of features.</span>
